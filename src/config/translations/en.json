The shift to alternative fuels—such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), Methanol, Ammonia, and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO)—is vital, as these fuels impact ship design, engine specifications, storage, and operations. Ships, built for over 20 years of service, need to be compatible with alternative fuels for future compliance. This urgency is reflected in the rising orders for LNG-fueled vessels, where fossil LNG is seen as a \"bridge fuel\" in the transition to greener options.",
